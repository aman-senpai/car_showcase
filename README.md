I recently built a Next.js 13 application as a learning project that showcases a collection of cars. I used a variety of modern technologies, including:

- Next.js 13
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

By working on this project, I learned how to build and deploy modern web applications with Next.js 13. I also learned about the new features in Next.js 13, such as server components, incremental static regeneration, and middleware.

In addition to Next.js 13, I also learned about React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds type safety to your code. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom components quickly and easily.

#### APIs Used

- **Car Data and Images**: I fetched car data and images from the [Imagin Studio Car Image API](https://www.imagin.studio/car-image-api).

- **Car Details**: For detailed car information, I used the [Cars by API Ninjas API](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/cars-by-api-ninjas).

In addition to the above, I also learned about software development best practices and deployment. I learned how to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code. I also learned how to use version control systems such as Git and how to test my code. Finally, I learned how to deploy my web application to production.
